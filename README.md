# ShopifyFix
When downloading a CSV file from Shopify, one finds unnecessary non-ASCII characters. Running this code outputs a new file without those characters. Very simple, not finished.

Trying to write a program that does this as easily as possible for a given user. At the moment my father is running a business and had been removing these characters by hand, a very tedious task.
