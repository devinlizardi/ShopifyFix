# ShopifyFix
When downloading a CSV file from Shopify, one finds unnecessary non-ASCII characters. Running this code outputs a new file without those characters. Very simple, not finished.

The code currently works, but I'm in the process of making it into an application, further simplifying ease of use. My father is running his company, Ramjet, through Shopify and when exporting his CSV file he's had to manually erase each unnecessary character so he can reupload the html. What I've written isn't too complicated, but most importantly, it works.
